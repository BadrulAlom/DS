    "<h4>What is the Taylor series and why is it important?</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The Taylor series is the idea that you can rewrite any smooth function (one who's shape can be described by a single formula) into a series of simpler \"generaized\" polynomials . Since (almost) all functions you encounter have a Taylor series, all functions can be thought of as \"generalized\" polynomials!\n",
    "\n",
    "2) For example we can write a function as a power series with center $x_0$ \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Highly recommend viewing this: http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/taylor-series.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Power series are easy to differentiate and integrate. No more techniques of integration, if one is satisfied with writing an integral as a power series!\n",
    "\n",
    "5) In finding integrals and solving differential equations, one often faces the problem that the solutions can't be \"found\", just because they do not have a name, i.e., they cannot be written down by combining the familiar function names and the familiar mathematical notation. The error function tex2html_wrap_inline159 and the functions describing the motion of a \"simple\" pendulum are important examples. Power series open the door to explore even functions like these! \n",
