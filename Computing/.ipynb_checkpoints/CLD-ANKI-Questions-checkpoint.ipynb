    "1. Reliability -  ability of a distributed system to deliver its services even when one or several of its software/hardware components fail. Assumption that a participating machine affected by a failure can always be replaced by another one, and not prevent the completion of a requested task – Needs redundancy of both software and data.\n",
    "2. Scalability -  ability of a distributed system to continuously evolve in order to support an ever-growing amount of tasks.\n",
    "3. Availability - failure detection via heartbeats and quick restart protocols. Replication on several nodes\n",
    "4. Efficiency - Can be measured in 2 ways: 1. The response time (or latency) which denotes the delay to obtain the first item, 2. The throughput (or bandwidth) which denotes the number of items delivered in a given period unit (e.g., a second)\n",

    "- The algorithm of Lamport timestamps is a simple algorithm used to determine the order of events in a distributed computer system. As different nodes or processes will typically not be perfectly synchronized, this algorithm is used to provide a partial ordering of events with minimal overhead, and conceptually provide a starting point for the more advanced vector clock method. They are named after their creator, Leslie Lamport.\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "- A Lamport clock does not allow a global ordering of all events. It lacks an important property, gap detection. Given two events e and e' and their logical clock values, LC(e) and LC(e'), it is impossible to establish if an event e\" exists such that LC(e) < LC(e\") < LC(e'). Vector clocks which contain info on all process states would fix this.\n",

    "1. Process p0 sends to itself a “take snapshot” message.\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "1. Client-Server - Assume a distributed architecture that consists of clients and servers. Clients initiate requests to servers. Separation of concerns\n",
    "2. Uniform Interface - All resources are accessed with a generic interface between client and server. This It simplifies and decouples the architecture, which enables each part to evolve independently which is Fundamental to RESTful design:\n",
    " - URIs (resource names)\n",
    " - HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)\n",
    " - HTTP response (status, body)\n",
    "3. Stateless - Server contains no client state. Each request from any client to server must contain enough context (i.e., all the information necessary) to process it. All messages are self-descriptive-  Any session state is held on the client.\n",
    "4. Cacheable - To improve network efficiency, clients should be able to cache responses (representations). Therefore responses must label themselves as cacheable, or not, to prevent clients reusing stale or inappropriate data.\n",
    "5. Layered System - A client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server, or to an intermediary along the way proxies, gateways, and firewalls etc. Intermediary servers may improve system scalability (e.g., by enabling load-balancing and providing shared caches) and they may also enforce security policies\n",
    "6) Code on Demand - Servers are able to temporarily extend or customize the functionality of a client by the transfer of executable code:\n",
    " - compiled components, e.g., Java applets\n",
    " - client-side scripts, e.g., JavaScript. This is the only optional constraint\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "- REST reuses the vocabulary of the well-known, well-defined HTTP protocol\n",
    "- SOAP encourages each application designer to define new, application specific methods that supplant HTTP methods\n",
    " - It disregards many of HTTP's existing capabilities (such as authentication, caching, and content-type negotiation)\n",
    " - It can work equally well over raw TCP, named pipes, message queues, etc."
