How do you normalize for sample size? Write an algorithm that computes all permutations of n elements. How do you sample permutations (that is, generate tons of <em>random</em> permutations) when n is large, to estimate the asymptotic distribution for your newly created metric? You may use this asymptotic distribution for normalizing your metric.

    "<li><span class=\"font-size-2\">More difficult, technical question related to previous one. There is an obvious one-to-one correspondence between permutations of n elements and integers between 1 and n! Design an algorithm that encodes an integer less than n! as a permutation of n elements. What would be the reverse algorithm, used to decode a permutation and transform it back into a number? <strong>Hint</strong>: An intermediate step is to use the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_number_system\" target=\"_blank\">factorial number system</a>&nbsp;representation of an integer. Feel free to check this reference online to answer the question. Even better, feel free to browse the web to find the full answer to the question (this will test the candidate's ability to quickly search online and find a solution to a problem without spending hours reinventing the wheel). &nbsp;</span></li>\n",
    "<li><span class=\"font-size-2\">How many \"useful\" votes will a Yelp review receive? <strong>My answer</strong>:&nbsp;Eliminate bogus accounts (<a href=\"http://www.analyticbridge.com/forum/topics/how-do-you-estimate-the-proportion-of-bogus-accounts-on-facebook\" target=\"_blank\">read this article</a>), or competitor reviews (how to detect them: use taxonomy to classify users, and location - two Italian restaurants in same Zip code could badmouth each other and write great comments for themselves). Detect&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.analyticbridge.com/profiles/blogs/invented-by-a-data-scientist-the-first-anti-scam\" target=\"_blank\">fake likes</a>: some companies (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fanmenow.com/buy-twitter-followers/\" target=\"_blank\">FanMeNow.com</a>)&nbsp;will charge you to produce fake accounts and fake likes. Eliminate prolific users who like everything, those who hate everything. Have a blacklist of keywords to filter fake reviews. See if IP address or IP block of reviewer is in a blacklist such as \"Stop Forum Spam\". Create honeypot to catch fraudsters.&nbsp; Also watch out for disgruntled employees badmouthing their former employer. Watch out for 2 or 3 similar comments posted the same day by 3 users regarding a company that receives very few reviews. Is it a brand new company? Add more weight to trusted users (create a category of trusted users). &nbsp;Flag all reviews that are identical (or nearly identical) and come from same IP address or same user. Create a metric to measure distance between two pieces of text (reviews).&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bigdatanews.com/profiles/blogs/fast-clustering-algorithms-for-massive-datasets\" target=\"_blank\">Create a review or reviewer taxonomy</a>. Use&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.analyticbridge.com/forum/topics/hidden-decision-trees-vs\" target=\"_blank\">hidden decision trees</a>&nbsp;to rate or score review and reviewers.</span></li>\n",
    "<li><span class=\"font-size-2\">What did you do today? Or what did you do this week / last week?</span></li>\n",

    "<li><span class=\"font-size-2\">Should removing stop words be Step 1 rather than Step 3, <a href=\"http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/building-better-search-tools-problems-and-solutions\" target=\"_blank\">in the search engine algorithm described here</a>? <strong>Answer</strong>: Have you thought about the fact that mine and yours could also be stop words? So in a bad implementation, data mining would become data mine after stemming, then data. In practice, you remove stop words before stemming. So Step 3 should indeed become step 1.&nbsp;</span></li>\n",
