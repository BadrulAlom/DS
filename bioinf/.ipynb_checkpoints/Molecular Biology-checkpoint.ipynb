    "1. Cells build new proteins from RNA (translation). RNA gets copies of the relevent portion of the DNA strand (transcription). All organic cells express their generitc information in this way.\n",
    "2. The hydrogen bonds that link base pairs are weak and hence allow DNA to be split without breakage of their backbones\n",
    "3. DNA is formed from an existing template strand (one half of the DNA) onto which a new strand is bound (other half the DNA)\n",

    "- 5 prime (5') to 3 (3') prime is a term biologists use to distinguish between the two halves of a DNA helix. Because one half of the DNA is essentially upside down to the other half, you can number each of the carbon atoms on the sugar 1,2,3,4,5.\n",
    "- The 5 prime carbon is outside the ring structure of the sugar. Depending on which side of the strand you are looking at the 5' prime will either come first in the count or last, and vice-versa for 3'.\n",
    "- DNA Polymerase can only work in the 5' to 3' (leading strand) direction\n",

    "7. DNA Polymerase - adds DNA bases. Can only work in the 5' to 3' direction, so this means one one hald it can keep zipping forwrd and build on a continuous basis. On the other half it has to wait for enough DNA to have been separated (known as Okazaki fragments), zip backwards, then wait for more to be unzipped. It's there not as quick at building as on the continuous side.\n",
